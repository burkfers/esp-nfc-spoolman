## That Which Inspects The Spools (working title)

This project, inspired by [nfc2klipper](https://github.com/bofh69/nfc2klipper),
uses an inexpensive NFC module and a wifi-capable microcontroller to read spool
tags and send the info to your printer.
nfc2klipper is nice, but I wanted to avoid running wires all the way from the top
of the printer to the electronics bay. By going wifi, I only needed to steal 5V
from the MMU, which conveniently is on the top.

**Features:**

- NFC Tag scanning and sending the info to Moonraker
- Supports a single neopixel or three simple LEDs for status display

**Typical Use Case:**

- Scan an NFC tag attached to a filament spool
- The microcontroller reads the tag info and send an update to Happy Hare
- Load the spool into your MMU
- Happy Hare now knows which spoolman SpoolID you just loaded and fetches the
  relevant details, and is ready to update filament usage

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)

## Troubleshooting

You can `ampy run test_pn532.py` to check for communication with the NFC module.
If you don't see

```
Found PN532 with firmware version: 1.6
```

(or other version), the wiring is probably not quite right yet.
